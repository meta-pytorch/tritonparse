Your task is to generate a Python script that runs a Triton kernel by IMPORTING it from its original file.

DO NOT copy the kernel's source code. The script must import it.

---
**Original Kernel and Parameters**

**Kernel Import Details:**
- File Path: `{{ kernel_info.file_path }}`
- Function to Import: `{{ kernel_info.function_name }}`

*(For your reference, the original source code was:)*
```python
{{ kernel_info.source_code }}
```

**Parameter Allocation Code:**
```python
{{ allocation_snippet }}
```

**Launch Kwargs:**
```json
{{ kwargs_dict }}
```

**Compile Options:**
```json
{{ compile }}
```
---
Now, generate the complete, self-contained Python script that will IMPORT and launch the kernel.
Remember to add the file's parent directory to `sys.path`.
