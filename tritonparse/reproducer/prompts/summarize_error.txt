You are an expert Triton debugging engineer. Your task is to extract and structure key debugging information from the following full error stack and log. Return a detailed, organized summary in a clear format. Ensure you include all of the following points:

- **Root Error Type**: Clearly state the lowest-level error, e.g., `CUDA_ERROR_ILLEGAL_ADDRESS`, `Misaligned Address`, `Invalid Memory Access`.
- **Error Location**: If possible, identify the likely location in the Triton kernel code where the error occurred (e.g., a `tl.load` or `tl.store` operation).
- **Key Tensor Analysis**: List all tensors relevant to the error. For each tensor, provide these details:
    - Name (e.g., `in_ptr0`, `out_ptr`)
    - Shape
    - Dtype
    - Stride
    - Is Contiguous
- **Root Cause Hypothesis**: Based on all the above information, provide your most likely technical hypothesis for why the error occurred. For example: 'Hypothesis: The error is caused by an out-of-bounds read on the input tensor `in_ptr1`. Its second dimension is 512, but the kernel's logic may be attempting to access an index beyond this range.'

Your output must be exhaustive. Preserve all details that could be useful for reproducing the issue. Do not simplify or omit numerical values like shapes or strides.
