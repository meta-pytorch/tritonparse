Analyze the following error log and provide a structured debugging report.
Your output must ONLY be the report, with no introductory text, conversational pleasantries, or apologies.

The report must contain these exact sections:
- **Root Error Type**: State the lowest-level error (e.g., `CUDA_ERROR_ILLEGAL_ADDRESS`).
- **Error Location**: Identify the likely location in the Triton kernel code (e.g., a `tl.load` or `tl.store`).
- **Key Tensor Analysis**: List all relevant tensors with their Name, Shape, Dtype, Stride, and Contiguous status.
- **Root Cause Hypothesis**: Provide your most likely technical hypothesis for the error's cause.

Begin your output directly with the "Root Error Type" section.
