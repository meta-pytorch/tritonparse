You are a debugging assistant.
Your task is to determine if two error messages, despite having different stack traces, point to the same underlying root cause.

Focus on the final error type and message, not the file paths or line numbers in the traceback.

---
**Target Error (A)**
(This is the error we want to reproduce)
```
{{ target_error }}
```

---
**Actual Error from Script (B)**
(This is the error the generated script produced)
```
{{ actual_error }}
```
---

Do these two errors represent the same underlying problem?
For example, if one is `torch.AcceleratorError: CUDA error: an illegal memory access was encountered` and the other is `triton.runtime.driver.OutOfResources: an illegal memory access was encountered`, they ARE the same root cause.
If one is an `illegal memory access` error and the other is a `misaligned address` error, they are NOT the same.
If one is a CUDA error and the other is a Python `RuntimeError` about storage size, they are NOT the same.

Answer with a single word: YES or NO.
