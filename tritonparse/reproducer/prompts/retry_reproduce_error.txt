Your previous attempt to generate an error-reproducing script failed because the script ran successfully.
Your goal is to create a script that FAILS in a specific way.

Review the original error analysis, and critically analyze the Python script you generated previously (which succeeded).
Generate a NEW version of the script that is more likely to trigger the target error.

You might need to:
- Adjust tensor initializations (e.g., introduce NaNs, Infs, or specific patterns).
- Modify scalar values to hit edge cases.
- Re-evaluate the kernel launch grid or other parameters if they might prevent the failure condition.

**Target Error Analysis Report**
(This is the error you MUST reproduce)
{{ error_analysis_report }}
---
**Your Previous (Unsuccessful) Code**
(This code ran successfully and needs to be fixed to fail)
```python
{{ prev_code_excerpt }}
```
---
Now, generate the complete, NEW, self-contained Python script that will correctly reproduce the error.
