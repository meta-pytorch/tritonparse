Your previous attempt to generate an error-reproducing script was unsuccessful.
The script either ran successfully, or it failed with the WRONG error type.

Your goal is to create a script that IMPORTS a kernel and FAILS with a specific root cause.

Review the original target error, your previous code, and the actual outcome.
Generate a NEW version of the script that is more likely to trigger the correct error.

**Target Error Analysis Report**
(This is the error you MUST reproduce)
```
{{ error_analysis_report }}
```
---
**Kernel Import Details:**
- File Path: `{{ kernel_info.file_path }}`
- Function to Import: `{{ kernel_info.function_name }}`
---
**Your Previous Code**
(This is the code you previously generated)
```python
{{ prev_code_excerpt }}
```
---
**Actual Outcome from Previous Code**
(This is what happened when the code ran. If it says "No error", it means the script ran successfully.)
```
{{ last_actual_error | default("No error.") }}
```
---
Critically analyze why your previous attempt failed.
Generate the complete, NEW, self-contained Python script that will correctly IMPORT and launch the kernel to reproduce the target error.
