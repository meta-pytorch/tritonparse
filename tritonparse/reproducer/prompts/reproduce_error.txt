Your task is to generate a Python script that precisely reproduces a specific error.
You are given the original kernel information and a detailed analysis of the error that occurred.
Your goal is to generate a script that FAILS with the described error.

DO NOT try to fix the bug.
DO NOT write a script that runs successfully.
The script must trigger the error outlined in the analysis report.

---
**Error Analysis Report**
{{ error_analysis_report }}
---
**Original Kernel and Parameters**
(This is the context in which the error originally occurred)

**Kernel Source:**
```python
{{ kernel_source }}
```

**Parameter Allocation Code:**
```python
{{ allocation_snippet }}
```

**Launch Kwargs:**
```json
{{ kwargs_dict }}
```

**Compile Options:**
```json
{{ compile }}
```
---
Now, generate the complete, self-contained Python script that will reproduce the error described in the report.
