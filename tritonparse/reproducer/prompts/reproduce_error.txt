Your task is to generate a Python script that precisely reproduces a specific error by IMPORTING the kernel.

DO NOT copy the kernel's source code. The script must import it from its original file.

---
**Error Analysis Report**
```
{{ error_analysis_report }}
```
---
**Original Kernel and Parameters**
(This is the context in which the error originally occurred)

**Kernel Import Details:**
- File Path: `{{ kernel_info.file_path }}`
- Function to Import: `{{ kernel_info.function_name }}`

*(For your reference, the original source code was:)*
```python
{{ kernel_info.source_code }}
```

**Parameter Allocation Code:**
```python
{{ allocation_snippet }}
```

**Launch Kwargs:**
```json
{{ kwargs_dict }}
```

**Compile Options:**
```json
{{ compile }}
```
---
Now, generate the complete, self-contained Python script that will IMPORT and launch the kernel to reproduce the error.
Remember to add the file's parent directory to `sys.path`.
